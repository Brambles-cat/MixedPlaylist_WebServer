TODO:
* Maybe dragging videos to switch their positions if that seems useful
* Fix ui for mobile devices
* Testing agenda from whiteboard
* Switch from render_template to make_response and use js to update visuals so the page doesn't need to reload for most actions
* Adding a video to the playlist should go through the validator and appear as ineligible if it doesn't pass the checks
* When making a playlist save the month for the current voting period
* Playlists made for earlier than current voting periods become inedible
